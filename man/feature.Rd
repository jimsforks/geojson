Feature objects:
\itemize{
 \item A feature object must have a member with the name "geometry". The
 value of the geometry member is a geometry object as defined above or a
 JSON null value.
 \item A feature object must have a member with the name "properties". The
 value of the properties member is an object (any JSON object or a JSON
 null value).
 \item If a feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier should be
 included as a member of the feature object with the name "id".
